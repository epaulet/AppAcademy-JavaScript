Maintaining both apps allows Google to give both types of users what they want.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=375400\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/375400/googles-waze-now-calculates-your-wait-time-in-traffic/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-04-02T09:07:10-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=375400\",\"dc_creator\":\"Zach Wener-Fligner\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/traffic-waze.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Cars are seen stuck in a traffic jam at Rama 9 road in Bangkok\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/traffic-waze.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/375400/googles-waze-now-calculates-your-wait-time-in-traffic/"], ["published_at", Thu, 02 Apr 2015 16:07:10 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Google&#8217;s Waze now calculates your wait time in traffic"], ["updated_at", Thu, 02 Apr 2015 17:39:09 UTC +00:00]]

It failed to translate into more seats in parliament, but made Clegg viable as the deputy prime minister he then became. Ever since, it\\u0026#8217;s been bittersweet for the Lib Dem leader.

But the style of debating they\\u0026#8217;re used to doesn’t come across well on screen. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2015/jan/19/are-prime-ministers-questions-past-sell-by-date-as-nick-clegg-argues\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EPrime Minister’s Questions\\u003C/a\\u003E is an arcane institution in which members of parliament gather every Wednesday lunchtime to perch or slouch on the green leather seats of the House of Commons, and shout at each other.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere have been calls from many quarters to do away with the “\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a622441/nick-clegg-calls-for-prime-ministers-questions-axe-its-a-farce.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Efarce\\u003C/a\\u003E,” which features aggressive and supremely old-fashioned insult-flinging, shouts of “shame!” and calls for “order, order.” It would be funny to watch if it wasn’t so boring, and didn’t represent the public face of British democracy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the latest round of television pre-election events, only one of which—tonight’s—is actually a debate in which politicians respond to one another, broadcasters are trying to do better. Both last week’s Channel 4/Sky program and tonight’s debate have a studio audience posing questions to the leaders. In last week\\u0026#8217;s, Jeremy Paxman, a career-griller of politicians, put Cameron and then Ed Milliband, the Labour leader, through their paces.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut the effect was hollow. Both leaders, intent on not slipping up, stuck doggedly to the party line and trotted out a stream of stats to back up their arguments. They thanked the audience for questions, re-phrased them to change the meaning, and gave answers that sounded pre-prepared. This wasn’t a conversation, but a performance of listening, and a parody of communication.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMaybe I, a British person unused to televised debate, am hoping for more than this limited format can offer. But I think most of us are watching not to hear a party line one more time, or even catch a stumble. We’re hoping to see something of the real person—to look into the leaders’ eyes, as much as many of us ever can do, and judge them on ineffable qualities like truthfulness and the ability to lead.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe medium is the message\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHeads of the seven political parties taking part in tonight’s debate will today, like this Quartz reporter, be en route to Salford in Greater Manchester, whence much of the country’s media has decamped in recent years both to economize and to decentralize away from London.

Nick Clegg, likely white knuckled but perhaps with little to lose, comes next. After him is Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party.

Then comes Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party, which gained huge momentum from a referendum on independence last year.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe last to speak will be Cameron, the Conservative prime minister who wants a second term but has stated he won’t \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2015/mar/24/david-cameron-shredded-wheat-and-the-art-of-stopping-after-two\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Etry for a third\\u003C/a\\u003E.

To fill in that gap, the researchers analyzed seed data from the US Geological Survey that just became available to estimate the share of corn and soybean land that used neonicotinoid-treated seeds. They then combined it with the non-seed treatment data and back-checked the total against information from the Environmental Protection Agency and the seed supplier DuPont Pioneer.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EThe strange thing is that this wild surge in US neonicotinoid use doesn\\u0026#8217;t appear to relate the the risk posed by insect pests, say the authors.

However, in Qidong, China, a former aflatoxin “hotspot,” 1 in 10 men succumbed to liver cancer by age 45 prior to market reforms of the 1980s.  Following increased trade with neighboring counties, residents of Qidong replaced corn with rice in the diet, and the liver cancer mortality rate was nearly cut in half over the next 30 years. This finding demonstrated that changing the diet to include foods that contain lower toxin levels may substantially improve public health.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDiet diversification not only reduces intake of these toxins but may also provide nutrients that counteract the negative affects of the toxin. This is likely to be the case in communities that consume large amounts of bitter cassava. Adhering to traditional preparation methods of sun drying and/or soaking cassava for 2-3 days reduces cyanogenic glycosides to safe levels.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EChildren are often at highest risk from adverse health effects.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWithout proper preparation, which occurs during food shortages, cassava cyanide can cause neurocognitive and neuromuscular problems, including a condition of permanent paralysis called “konzo.” Increasing dietary sulfur amino acids, which aid in cyanide detoxification in the body, reduces the risk of konzo. A diverse diet less dependent on cassava and richer in sulfur amino acids found in eggs, dairy, meat and legumes can reduce cyanide poisoning.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPromoting nutritional diversity, thus reducing toxin exposure and counteracting toxicity, is easier said than done.

There need to be changes to food policy, public health and education programs for farmers that encourage greater diversity of foods in diets, and reduce the proportion of foods that are known to contain naturally occurring toxins. Also we need to further educate people that reliance on a single food source may have health ramifications.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIdeally, through these efforts, we can honor food traditions while increasing agricultural biodiversity, promoting trade and maintaining a stable, yet diverse food supply in low-income regions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=375279\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/375279/a-monotonous-diet-isnt-just-boring-its-dangerous/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-04-02T07:01:20-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=375279\",\"dc_creator\":\"Felicia Wu\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/rtr1b7n6.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Bolivian Indian women sells casava in front of campaign advertisement for presidential candidate Evo Morales\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/rtr1b7n6.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/375279/a-monotonous-diet-isnt-just-boring-its-dangerous/"], ["published_at", Thu, 02 Apr 2015 14:01:20 UTC +00:00], ["title", "A monotonous diet isn&#8217;t just boring, it&#8217;s dangerous"], ["updated_at", Thu, 02 Apr 2015 17:39:09 UTC +00:00]]

The actively disengaged group, meanwhile, can cost the US economy close to $400 billion per year. So not only are employees walking out the door because their bosses can\\u0026#8217;t or won\\u0026#8217;t engage them, but it also leaves a whole lot of money on the table.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;Engagement is strongly connected to business outcomes that are essential to an organization’s financial success, including productivity, profitability and customer ratings,\\u0026#8221; the report said. \\u0026#8220;And engaged employees are the ones who are the most likely to drive the innovation, growth and revenue that their companies desperately need.\\u0026#8221;\\u003Cb\\u003E \\u003C/b\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2013/03/4-reasons-why-investing-employee-engagement-matters/62098/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EOther recent reports\\u003C/a\\u003E corroborate Gallup\\u0026#8217;s conclusions: US federal agencies lose $65 billion per year from lost productivity alone, according to Deloitte.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf there\\u0026#8217;s any type of silver lining, it\\u0026#8217;s that this lack of engagement is really only coming from one sex: Yes, you guessed it, men.

Wilson, forensic psychologists at the University of Liverpool, in a 2013 analysis for the \\u003Cem\\u003EJournal of Police and Criminal Psychology\\u003C/em\\u003E. “Attacks on these targets evoke a strong emotional response.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Schools and other educational institutions represent ‘soft targets,’” they added. “A soft target is a relatively unguarded site where people congregate, normally in large numbers, thus offering the potential for mass casualties.” But practicalities aside, there are also specific, political and cultural reasons a terrorist cell might target a school or university. And this is where such acts diverge from the usual modes of modern terror.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThough bombing public transport takes months, if not years of intensive planning, it is intended to make the act appear random—anyone could become a victim by passing through at the wrong time. The terrifying power of this particular terror tactic is, after all, its unpredictability. An ideological message is usually announced in the aftermath.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAttacking schools, however, is predictable because the act \\u003Cem\\u003Eis \\u003C/em\\u003Ethe message. Terrorists who attack schools intend to deplete the number of institutions disseminating philosophies ostensibly contradictory to their worldview; “Boko Haram,” roughly translated from the Hausa language means “\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-27390954\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EWestern education is forbidden\\u003C/a\\u003E.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“They’re attacking what they see as the institutions of culture, and in particular the institutions of Western culture,” Ebrahim Moosa, professor of Islamic studies at the University of Notre Dame, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2014/1216/Pakistan-school-attack-Why-children-are-becoming-a-more-common-terror-target\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Etold\\u003C/a\\u003E The Christian Science Monitor following the attacks in Peshawar. “They see that the process of Westernization begins at school, so schools that violate strict Islamic education become targets.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s not difficult to see why Garissa was targeted. Kenyan schools consistently rank toward the best in the region, and the overall Kenyan population demonstrates one of the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_statistics.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehighest literacy rates\\u003C/a\\u003E on the continent. It is also a highly diverse place, with regards to religion and ethnicity, not unlike many African countries occupying the borderlands between Muslim-dominated North Africa and the Christian-dominated south. Consequently, Kenyan schools and universities are well-positioned for the maximal exchange of cultures, politics, and ideas—a concept that stands in direct opposition to the rigid ideologies of groups like al-Shabab.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAl-Shabab has a history of interfering in local education. In areas of Somalia under the group’s control, once co-ed schools have been gender segregated, with the majority of girls \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/1806/Al-Shabaab_Devastates_Education_for_Kids\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ebeing intimidated against enrolling\\u003C/a\\u003E, if not forcibly removed from schools all together.

Previously, Iran\\u0026#8217;s negotiators had stuck to a strategy stated by supreme leader Ali Khamenei, which was to seek a single, all-encompassing agreement to be announced June 30.

Its affiliation with Twitter seems like a real strength, considering Twitter\\u0026#8217;s distribution power, its ability to directly integrate Periscope, and its relationships with media and celebrities. But it\\u0026#8217;s hardly clear if this will be a winner-take-all market—or whether live streaming will simply become a feature of every social product, from Snapchat to WhatsApp. (And—if so—if someone will purchase Meerkat for a lot of money.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;This is not a zero-sum game,\\u0026#8221; Josh Elman, the Greylock partner who just led Meerkat\\u0026#8217;s \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.greylock.com/investment-meerkat-power-spontaneous-togetherness/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E$12 million financing round\\u003C/a\\u003E, tells Quartz.

From a practical standpoint, mobile networks are now fast enough in many places to support high-quality video streaming. (Our early experience with these services, however, has been flaky.) Screens are bigger, and people are simply \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/365293/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ewatching more video on their phones\\u003C/a\\u003E.

In our experience so far, some streams have been pleasant, such as a live view of Tokyo\\u0026#8217;s Shibuya crossing. Some have been amusing. Others have been grotesque, such as a man using the toilet. None has been worth watching for more than a few moments.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe real magic seems to be the immediacy and breadth of available streams. There are still some questions to be worked out around the incentives for people to create and watch streams, especially once the initial curiosity and experimentation wears off. But there seems to be something here. The real key for Meerkat and Periscope, now, is to build the best possible tools for creating and participating in these streams, and making them an essential part of millions of lives.
